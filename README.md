#ihaveArrived
Easy way to find and connect with your friends no matter where you are! 
The app allows users to use precise latitude and longitude locations, as well as directions, to be able to find each other in large crowded places. 
Examples include finding a host at a tailgate event, meeting up with friends at a concert or festival, or even making contact with a delivery person. 

Prerequisites:
If you are trying to work the app by yourself, you will need to simulate 2 different users. In order to accomplish this, open the same link in 2 different tabs or windows.

Running the app:
In order to run the app accurately, you will have to assume the role of both users. 
1. Start by entering a name and email address to create User 1. 
2. Navigate to the other tab/window, and enter a username and email address for User 2.
3. Navigate back to User 1's tab, and click the 'ihaveArrived' button. 
4. Navigate to User 2's tab, and click the 'onTheWay' button.

Break down:
The app requires a sequential order. 
- Once User 1 exists, the  option to create User 2 is available. 
- Once User 2 exists, User 1 is given the option to click the 'ihaveArrived' button.
- Once User 1 has clicked the 'ihaveArrived' button, User 2 is given the option to click the 'onTheWay' button. 
- Once User 2 has clicked the 'onTheWay' button, all parties are notified of their current status.
